What are the steps we follow while creating a prediction model

Step 1:We first import all the dependencies/ libraries.
Step 2: Then we get the data to train and test the model
Step 3: Then we split the data to train and test the model.
Step 4: Then we scale the data to make it of equal size.
Step 5: Then we fit the data into the logistic regression model.
Step 6: Then we make predictions

MVC Architecture
Model View Controller
Model is generally referred to the Database, if any. Here, we are not using any Databases.
View is referred to the API, which accepts a request and returns a response.
Controller is the part that does all the heavy work, i.e, data processing, building classifier, etc.
